<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My full name is Darren Dulguime Cocjin and as of March 22, 2024 in the Phillipine Timezone my current role is a Real Time Analyst where I provide site performance level based on the Service Level Agreement.</p>

<p>I currently live with my brother and mother in Marikina City Philippines. Although I didn't grew up here I do love people here around me because it's too peaceful here. It's like I'm living in a big subdivision. There's no noise, the area isn't polluted and the roads here are in good condition.</p>

<p>I want to make a progress in my life so I'm taking this course to become a full-fledge web developer and one day be part of a bigger company that contributes to a wider environment. Hopefully this course is my first step to becoming a web developer or becoming a great programmer.</p>
